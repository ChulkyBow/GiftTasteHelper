Stardew Valley NPC Gift Taste Helper
====================================

This mod displays a helpful tooltip that shows an NPC's favourite gifts when hovering over their birthday on the calendar.
This works with both the calendar furniture item that you can have in your house, as well as the calendar on the billboard in town.

Note that it currently does not include the two universal loved items, but may in the future.

## Requirements

This mod works with the most recent version of Stardew Valley as well as the 1.07 beta.

This mod requires [SMAPI](https://github.com/ClxS/SMAPI) to run. It currently works with the latest version (39.5) as well as a few of the previous ones.

## Installation

1. Download the latest release [here](https://github.com/tstaples/GiftTasteHelper/releases).

## Future Features

- Displaying the tooltip when hovering over the gift icon in the social tab.
- Display more than just loved gifts (if I can find a way to do it without clutting the UI).
